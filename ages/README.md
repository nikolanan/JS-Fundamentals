Write a function that determines whether based on the given age a person is: a baby, child, teenager, adult or elder.
The input comes as a single number parameter. The bounders are:

• 0-2 (age) – is a baby;
• 3-13 (age) – is a child;
• 14-19 (age) – is a teenager;
• 20-65 (age) – is an adult;
• >=66 (age) – is an elder;
• In all other cases print – "out of bounds";
The output should be printed to the console.
