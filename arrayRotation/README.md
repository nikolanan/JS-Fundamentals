Write a function that receives an array and the number of rotations you have to perform.

Note: Depending on the number of rotations, the first element goes to the end.

Output:
Print the resulting array elements separated by a single space.


Sample input: [51, 47, 32, 61, 21], 2

Sample output: 32 61 21 51 47

Sample input: [32, 21, 61, 1], 4 

Sample output: 32 21 61 1

Sample input: [2, 4, 15, 31], 5

Sample output: 4 15 31 2
