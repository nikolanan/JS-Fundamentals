Create a function, which creates a register for heroes, with their names, level, and items (if they have such).
The input comes as an array of strings. Each element holds data for a hero, in the following format:
"{heroName} / {heroLevel} / {item1}, {item2}, {item3}..."
You must store the data about every hero. The name is a string, a level is a number and the items are all strings.

The output is all of the data for all the heroes youâ€™ve stored sorted ascending by level. The data must be in the
following format for each hero:

Hero: {heroName}

level => {heroLevel}

Items => {item1}, {item2}, {item3}


Sample input:

    [
    'Isacc / 25 / Apple, GravityGun',
    'Derek / 12 / BarrelVest, DestructionSword',
    'Hes / 1 / Desolator, Sentinel, Antara'
    ]

Sample output:

    Hero: Hes
    level => 1
    items => Desolator, Sentinel, Antara
    Hero: Derek
    level => 12
    items => BarrelVest, DestructionSword
    Hero: Isacc
    level => 25
    items => Apple, GravityGun

Sample input:

    [
    'Batman / 2 / Banana, Gun',
    'Superman / 18 / Sword',
    'Poppy / 28 / Sentinel, Antara'
    ]

Sample output:

    Hero: Batman
    level => 2
    items => Banana, Gun
    Hero: Superman
    level => 18
    items => Sword
    Hero: Poppy
    level => 28
    items => Sentinel, Antara
