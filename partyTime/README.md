There is a party. Many guests are invited and there are two types: VIP and regular. When guests come to
the party check if he/she is in any of the two reservation lists.

The input will come as an array of strings. You will be given the list of the guests before you receive a command
"PARTY".

All VIP numbers start with a digit.

When you receive the command "PARTY", the guests start coming.

Print the count of guests and then all guests, who didn't come to the party (VIP must be printed first).
